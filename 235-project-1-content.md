# Project 1 Game Treatment

## I.High Concept

  It's a dress up game with a slight twist. What more do you need? Unleash your inner fashionista!

## II. Genre
  
    The game will be a dress up simulation.

## III. Platform

    This game will first be developed specifically for desktops, and if development goes well and there is a 
    surplus of time, we might focus on a mobile version.
     
## IV. Story

    The story is very simple. Chloe is about to leave to venture into the outside world and needs to get dressed. 
    But like all of her mornings, she is super indecisive and needs your help!
     
## V. Esthetics

    The graphics will revolve around a simple cartoonish style. Our stylistic inspiration comes from Doki Doki 
    Literature Club. The sound will also be simple and will mostly be a simple loop of calm music playing in the
    background with a few added sound effects when clothes are selected.
    
## VI. Gameplay
  
    Mechanics:
        The player will use the mouse to select from the clothing options provided by dragging and dropping them onto 
        Chloe. When finished the player will press a finish button and will be presented with an image of their 
        final product
        
    Controls:
        Mouse Drag and Drop: The player will drag and drop clothing items onto Chloe
        
    Onboarding:
        The instructions on how to play the game will be displayed on the main menu screen before the game 
        begins. This should ensure that the player is well informed on the controls and mechanics of the game 
        before beginning.
    
    Player Learning:
        There is not much learning behavior in this game. The instructions present most of the necessary controls and 
        any information needed to play the game.
