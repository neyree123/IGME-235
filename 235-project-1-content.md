# Project 1 Game Treatment

## I.High Concept

  Insert One-Liner Here

## II. Genre
  
    The game will be a simple shoot 'em up in which your main goal is to shoot the enemies before they shoot you.

## III. Platform

    This game will first be developed specifically for desktops, and if development goes well and there is a surplus of time, 
     I might focus on a mobile version.
     
## IV. Story

    Wait there is a story?
     
## V. Esthetics

    The graphics will revolve around a simple cartoonish style. The player and enemies will likely end up being vector images 
    with a simplistic style. The sound will also be simplistic and will be focused around the scoring system so that the player 
    is alerted when reaching a certain score. If time permits, I might add more simple sound effects to the enemies to alert the
    player for certain events in the game such as an enemies death or the player being hit. 
    
## VI. Gameplay
  
    ### Mechanics:
        The player will use the mouse to navigate their character around the screen, which will be constantly shooting bullets at 
        a set time interval. Their goal is to dodge incoming bullets while taking out the enemies with their attacks. In addition 
        to dodging bullets, the user can pick up collectible with small buffs such as shooting multiple bullets at once or a 
        short period of invincibility.
        
    #### Controls:
        Mouse movement: The player's character will follow the mouse on screen.
        
    ### Onboarding:
        The instructions on how to play the game will be displayed on the main menu screen before the game begins. This should ensure
        that the player is well informed on the controls and mechanics of the game before beginning.
    
    ### Player Learning:
        The key mechanics that the player will have to learn to beat the game revolve around understanding the enemies attacks and the 
        types of powerups available. The more they play, the more information they gain and the higher their success rate.
